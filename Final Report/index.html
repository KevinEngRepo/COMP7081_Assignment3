				<ul>
					<li>The reviewed system design is a portion of an overall SuperRent system. The user this section of the product is focused upon is the customer. No functionality for managers or employees will be discussed in this design document or this review.  The document concentrates of four major areas of functionality: customer vehicle rental, vehicle return, point deduction, and insurance purchase.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Customer Vehicle Rental: After the customers provide their information, they can make a reservation and have the rental agreement with credit card payment information.</li>
							<li>Vehicle Return: Customers need to provide the following information, time, odometer reading and whether the gas tank has been refilled.</li>
							<li>Point Deduction: The reward system includes the rules about how to collect points and deduct points. 
								<ul>
								<li>When a customer joins the club, he or she receives 500 points. After the initial points, club members gain 1 point for every $5 they spend.</li>
								<li>To deduct the points, the club members can exchange 1,000 points for a one day rental of a premium or lower-ranking car. Alternatively, 1,500 points for a one day rental for a luxury car, SUV, van or truck.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Insurance Purchasing: The customer can decide whether they need to have insurance purchase for the whole rental period. The payment need to be made at the point that vehicle is returned. </li>

								<td>
								Has the UI been designed effectively with use cases in mind?
								</td>
								<td>
								There are many prime examples of UI usage, but some functionalities aren't completely covered in terms of user stories. For instance, the points deduction system is hardly discussed and we aren't given a clear idea of how the the points are used.

			<li id="subtitle">Results of the formal review of the System Requirement</li>
				<ul>
<<<<<<< HEAD
					<li>In the Vehicle Class, no specifications are placed and only references other tables are made. No requirement set to track vehicle beyond type. No date of purchase, no color, no requirements beyond referencing another table.</li>
					<li>The class structure seems strange to have a one-to-one between carRentalReservation and vehicle, this will prevent a vehicle to be available in the system for other CarRentalReservation. This will require deleting the CarRentalReservation entries to free up vehicles in the database as a requirement. As a result, the requirement to track everything but CarRentalReservation StartDate and confirmation number is removed.</li> 
					<li>DFD diagrams up to level 2 data flow are consistent and concise describing correct states and with well-defined transitions.</li>
					<li>Even though there is reference in the original requirement and design document introduction, in the original user stories there is no mention that a customer can use points to purchase days of rent the only requirement placed on the system in the user stories is to allow the customer to pay for their insurance with points. </li>
					<li> For the CarSalesAgreement class, the requirement to track the start and end time of a sales agreement is not shown anywhere in the customer requirements and having separate fields for it seems odd also tracking the odometer reading in that class where is it coming from?</li>
=======
					<li>Vehicle Class no specification’s placed only references other classes. No requirement made to track vehicle beyond type. No date of purchase, no color, no requirements beyond a referencing other classes.</li>
					<li>The class structure seems strange to have a one-to-one between carRentalReservation and Vehicle though this will allow to lock off the vehicle from other CarRentalReservations this will mean deleting the CarRetanlReservation entries to free up vehicles in the database as a requirement this also removes a requirement to track everything but StartDate and confirmation number that is in CarRentalReservation.</li> 
					<li>DFD diagrams are up to level 2 data flow is consistent and concise describing correct states and with well-defined transitions. Though missing a description is should be all right to follow without it though would have been nice to see some kind of description accompanying the diagram.</li>
					<li>Nowhere in the user stories is it mentioned that a customer can use points to purchase rental days. Even though it is stated in the background that this is a requirement. The only requirement placed on the points system in the user stories is to allow the customer to pay for their insurance with points. There should be user story for renting using points and then the requirement should be placed through out the rest of the document so the implementation will not miss this crucial functionality. </li>
					<li> For the CareSalesAgreement class, the requirement to track the start and end time of a sales agreement is not shown anywhere in the customer requirements neither is it stated anywhere in the user stories. Then tracking the odometer reading in that class shows off the lack of information stored in the vehicle class which has not attributes. Where is it coming from if it isn't coming from the vehicle it self?</li>

					<li>In the Database why are we tracking gas level in the vehicle table not in the rental records table as all cars should be full on leaving so there is no need to track a starting amount only a return amount at it will be fluctuating based on who used it last also should be tied not just to the car but to the renter.</li>
					<li>A customer can only have one rental agreement</li> 
					<li>Each vehicle type can only be attached to one vehicle. Which means there can be only one type of each vehicle in the database.</li>
					<li>No specific data types are mentioned which makes it difficult for the reviewers to understand the intended usage of data.</li>
					<li>CarRentalReservation references a vehicle type. Vehicle type is not referenced as an attribute anywhere else in the class diagram.</li>
					<li>Vehicle appears to store a large number of functions with a small number of attributes also there are no id number referenced.</li>
=======
					<li> The tracking gas level in the vehicle table not in the rental records table seems redundant as all cars should be full on leaving. The return fluctuation is based on who used it last not on the specific car and has more to do with how to charge the customer then on the current status of the vehicle so is should be tied not to the car but to the renter.</li>
					<li>With the one to one cardinality between the Customer table and RentalSaleAgreement table a customer can only have one rental agreement ever. This means that the RentalSalesAgreement table must be deleted to allow for a customer to rent another car. Since a number of other tables reference the RentalSalesAgreement table this would leave them orphans with no connection to the costumer table. This is a major design flaw which would create major issues in implementation. </li> 
					<li>Another one to one cardinality issues between VehicleType and the Vehicle table.Each vehicle type can only be attached to one vehicle. Which means there can be only one type of each vehicle in the database. This just makes having a separate table for type redundant as for every vehicle you would have to create a new type entry.</li>
					<li>No specific data types are mentioned which makes it difficult for the reviewers to understand the intended usage of data. Adding data types in the design document would show the user estimated memory usage and also how the information could be sorted and accessed.</li>
					<li>CarRentalReservation references a vehicle type. Vehicle type is not referenced as an attribute anywhere else in the class diagram. The attribute would seem to make sense  to exist also in the vehicle class or at least one it is connected too other wise we have no idea where the type is coming from.</li>
					<li>Vehicle appears to store a large number of functions with a small number of attributes with no id number referenced. This means that in the class there is no way to differentiate vehicles from each other based on an attribute it contains. A number of the functions placed inside the Vehicle class seem out of place attached directly to the vehicle. addInsurance is also used in CarInsurance the question of why are there two addInsurane functions seem obvious as the tables are not connected directly to each other to show one may draw from the other. The deductPoint() function seems like it should be kept in the classes that handle payment not directly on the Vehicle. Other suspect functions include makeCashPayment(), and makeCreditCardPayment() these functions though needed should be placed in a different class. </li>

			<li id="subtitle">Feedback on your experience of having your project reviewed</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Group 1’s review was organized, thought full, and honest. They had a good set of questions that focused upon a number of issues with our documents’ content. The organization of the review was fairly structured and they had very flexible sections to allow for change. No point was pressed upon too hard and no critical or judgemental comments were made.
					</li>
					<li>
					They did not seem to completely understand a few of their questions, but that may have been due to not having enough notes. They did keep the review strictly focused towards the document. Most questions were well-worded and directly pointed to the document.  Their questions were used to draw more information out about the document, the systems’ design, and to not criticize design choices.
					</li>
					<li>
					We accepted and applied their review recommendations in the areas they found lacking. Overall, the review was found to be very a positive experience. The reviewers were very effective in their task and we look forward to seeing the results of their final report.
