			<li>Project Background</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This project is one of the components for the SuperRent system. The user in this component is the customer. The system mainly includes four activities: customer vehicle rental, return, point deduction, and insurance purchase:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Customer Vehicle Rental: after the customers provide their information, they can make a reservation and have the rental agreement with credit card payment information.</li>
							<li>Vehicle Return: Customers need to provide the following information, time, odometer reading and whether the gas tank has been refilled.</li>
							<li>The reward system includes the rules about how to collect points and deduct points. When a customer joins the club, he or she receives 500 points. After the initial points, club members gain 1 point for every $5 they spend. To deduct the points, the club members can exchange 1,000 points for a one day rental of a premium or lower-ranking car. Alternatively, 1,500 points for a one day renal for a luxury car, SUV, van or truck.</li>
							<li>The customer can decide whether they need to have insurance purchase for the whole rental period. The payment need to be made at the point that vehicle is returned. </li>
						</ul>	
					<li>The component in this project will help the company collect information about vehicle rental, return, payment, customer point tracking, and insurance purchase.</li>
