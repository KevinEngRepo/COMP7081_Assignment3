				<ul>
					<li>The reviewed system design is a portion of an overall SuperRent system. The user this section of the product is focused upon is the customer. No functionality for managers or employees will be discussed in this design document or this review.  The document concentrates of four major areas of functionality: customer vehicle rental, return, point deduction, and insurance purchase.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Customer Vehicle Rental: After the customers provide their information, they can make a reservation and have the rental agreement with credit card payment information.</li>
							<li>Vehicle Return: Customers need to provide the following information, time, odometer reading and whether the gas tank has been refilled.</li>
							<li>Point Deduction: The reward system includes the rules about how to collect points and deduct points. 
								<ul>
								<li>When a customer joins the club, he or she receives 500 points. After the initial points, club members gain 1 point for every $5 they spend.</li>
								<li>To deduct the points, the club members can exchange 1,000 points for a one day rental of a premium or lower-ranking car. Alternatively, 1,500 points for a one day rental for a luxury car, SUV, van or truck.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Insurance Purchasing: The customer can decide whether they need to have insurance purchase for the whole rental period. The payment need to be made at the point that vehicle is returned. </li>

								There is very little mention of covering for software correctness in the requirements

								The reports’ Use Cases give brief expectations of what the software is capable of and the resulting output

								How is purpose and scope clearly defined for this project?

								The overall project purpose and scope was covered in the Use Case diagram. Though there could have been more elaboration.

							<tr>
								<td>
								Are references to policies, directives, procedures, standards, and terminology provided?

								<td>
								Procedures were explained in the sequence and data flow diagrams. Directives and standards are established in the Use cases. In terms of policies and terminology, there weren’t any examples of a data dictionary to explain terms to non-experts stakeholders.

								Are there any and all constraints/limitations that can be identified?

								No constraints or limitations were defined for this project. Instead, there are only mentions of functional requirements.

								<td>
								How well defined does the purpose explain how the scope of the project can handle and adjust for new requirements?

								<td>
								The project doesn’t appear to have room for any possible additional requirements. The project scope only explains what components the developers wanted to cover.

								What kinds of plans are specified for software components?

								<td>
								The plans only specify the components for customer vehicle rental, return, point deduction, and insurance purchase.

							<tr>
								<td>
								Can the project life cycle allow for newly introduced required components and how can this be accomplished?
								</td>
								<td>
								There doesn’t appear to be any room for any new requirements or components in the project timeline due to the strict Scrum development cycle.

								<td>
								Based on existing documentation/information, do you understand the system in the context of each of the views in the system engineering hierarchy?

								Yes; Upon further review, this documentation seems specifically designed for expert users and does not allow for much room for novice end-users

								Yes, the Use Cases and sequence  diagrams cover the expected resulting output

								No; There is no specified novice or expert interactions. Only base user requirements defined

								Have important interfaces to all system elements been described?
								</td>
								<td>
								Yes, the class diagrams clearly describe the important interfaces of which the user can interact with.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
								Is the behaviour of the software consistent with the information it must process and the functions it must perform? 
								</td>
								<td>
								Yes; use cases, sequence diagrams, and data flow diagrams map out the software process by explaining from the point where the user inputs their data, how the system utilises the information, and what is the resulting output
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
								Has the UI been designed effectively with the use cases in mind?
								</td>
								<td>
								There are many prime examples of UI usage, but some functionalities aren't completely covered in terms of user stories. For instance, the points deduction system is hardly discussed and we aren't given a clear idea of how the the points are used.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
								Have business requirements been met in the use cases?
								</td>
								<td>
								Not entirely, the document only specifies the component functionalities for customer vehicle rental, return, point deduction, and insurance purchase.

								<td>
								Have all users been identified?

								Yes, the component this project covers is primarily meant for the customer end-user

				<ul>
					<li>Vehicle Class no specification’s placed only references other tables. No requirement made to track vehicle beyond type. No date of purchase, no color, no requirements beyond a referencing another table.</li>
					<li>The class structure seems strange to have a one-to-one between carRentalReservation and vehicle though this will allow to lock of the vehicle for other CarRentalReservation this will mean deleting the CarRetanlReservation entries to free up vehicles in the database as a requirement this also removes a requirement to track everything but StartDate and confirmation number that is in CarRentalReservation.</li> 
					<li>DFD diagrams are up to level 2 data flow is consistent and concise describing correct states and with well-defined transitions.</li>
					<li>Nowhere in the original user stories is it mentioned that a customer can use points to purchase days of rent the only requirement placed on the system in the user stories is to allow the customer to pay for their insurance with points. Even though this is referenced in the Introduction</li>
					<li> For the CareSalesAgreement class, the requirement to track the start and end time of a sales agreement is not shown anywhere in the customer requirements and having separate fields for it seems odd also tracking the odometer reading in that class where is it coming from?</li>

								The project document doesn’t define a reusable software schema.

								Does the each component in the design have specific, clear and well defined operations in the each interface?

								The component diagram doesn’t clearly define an interface for access. Each component designed very roughly and the interconnectivity is not very well-defined.

								Analysis and Recommendations
								</th>
								<td>
								The design document doesn’t consider software reusability for the legacy and the target system. To improve the system quality and to reduce project cost, it is recommended that the project adopts software reuse strategy and technology.
								An especially good example we would recommend is RAS(Reusable Asset Specification) by the OMG(Object Management Group). These are a set of guidelines and recommendations about the structure, content, and descriptions of reusable software assets.

					<li>Database why are we tracking gas level in the vehicle table not in the rental records table as all cars should be full on leaving so there is no need to track a starting amount only a return amount at it will be fluctuating based on who used it last also should be tied not just to the car but to the renter.</li>
					<li>A customer can only have one rental agreement</li> 
					<li>each vehicle type can only be attached to one vehicle.</li>
					<li>no data types are mentioned</li>
					<li>CarRentalReservation references a vehicle type vehicle type is not referenced as an attribute anywhere else in the class diagram.</li>
					<li>Vehicle appears to store a large number of functions with a small number of attributes also no id number referenced.</li>
